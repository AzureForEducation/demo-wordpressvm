# Creating a new Virtual Machine (VM)

As mentioned earlier, there are a plenty of resources we're going to build in this demo and the whole thing is going to live in a single Linux-based (Ubuntu) VM. This way, we're going to start this process by creating our virtual machine host through the Azure Portal.

## Creating a new VM

1) In the Azure Portal, select the resource group we created in a earlier demo. Once inside of it, on the top menu, click on "+ Add" button. By doing this, the portal is going to show you a new window with several services suggestion. On the "Search" field type "Virtual Machine" and select the option "Ubuntu 16.04", as shown by picture below.
