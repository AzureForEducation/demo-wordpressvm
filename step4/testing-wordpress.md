# Step 4 - Testing Wordpress

Last but not least, we need to call out the Wordpress through the browser and fulfill some final information. To get there, in your personal computer, go to your preferred browser and, on the navigation bar type your VM's public IP.

   <code>http://{public-ip}/wordpress</code>

By doing this, you should be able to see a screen pretty similar to that one presented to the image below.

Fulfill that piece of information left and then, click on "Install Wordpress". Done. Wordpress is fully installed, configured and ready to be used. Below you can see our Wordpress up and running.

Congratulations! You've made it. Let's go to the next challenge.
