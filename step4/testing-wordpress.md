# Step 4 - Testing Wordpress

Last but not least, we need to call out the Wordpress through the browser and fullfil some final information. To get there, in your personal computer, go to your prefered browser and, on the navigation bar type your VM's public IP.

   <code>http://{public-ip}/wordpress</code>

By doing this you should be able to see a screen pretty similar to that one presented to the image below.

Fullfil that peace of information lefting and then, click in "Install Wordpress". Done. Wordpres is fully installed, configured and ready to be used.
