# Step 3 - Installing Wordpress

We're almost there. The very next thing we need to do is to download Wordpress in our server, once we don't have it so far.

To get that, within your VM please go after the following steps.

1) Download Wordpress to your current directory.

```shell
curl -O https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
```

2) Now we have it, let's "untar" that file we just downloaded. To get that, type the following command-line.

```shell	
tar xvzf latest.tar.gz
```
